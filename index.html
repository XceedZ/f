					<h3 class="main-article__subjudul">A Dark Night</h3>
					<p class="main-article__paragraph">Deep within the dense woods lies the "Fairy Forest." Unlike the typical fairy tales of joy, this forest conceals secrets in every shadow.

Melodic, haunting tunes fill the air, concealing deep melancholy.
						<br> <br>
						The forest's inhabitants are fairies, beautiful yet bearing dark secrets. Some are banished, seeking refuge from the world. Others have hidden mysteries for centuries.
						<br> <br>
						Amidst the forest's allure, one tale stands out – fairies daring to challenge their fate and unveil the forest's long-hidden secrets. Join us on this thrilling adventure into the heart of this dark fairy woodland.
					</p>
					<p class="main-article__paragraph">In the darkness of the Fairy Forest, destiny was weaving intertwining threads. Amid the shy moonlight casting its glow upon the trees, two figures emerged beneath the lush canopy.
						<br> <br>
						The first was Persephone, a fairy with glistening black wings that resembled the night itself. Her deep eyes radiated profound curiosity, and her steps were light as she navigated the hidden pathways. The second was Orion, a rebellious fairy with a piercing gaze and a perpetually enigmatic smile on his lips. They met in this enigmatic forest, their fates entwining in unfathomable ways.
						<br> <br>
						Moments after their encounter, the wind whispered, and the trees swayed as if welcoming their arrival. What will unfold next in the dark tale of the Fairy Forest? Keep reading to uncover the mysteries behind this encounter.
